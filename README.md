# Title of Project
Weather Dashboard

## Website Description
The website enables a user to search a city or select it from suggestions to display a weather forecast for the upcoming days.

## Challenge Description
The weather dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It uses OpenWeather One Call API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. It uses localStorage to store persistent data.


## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
